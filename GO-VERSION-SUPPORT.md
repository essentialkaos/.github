## Go Version Support Policy

By default, all packages, services, applications, and utilities written with Golang support the last two minor versions (_for example, 1.22 and 1.23_). You can check the latest versions on [this page](https://go.dev/dl/). Some packages may support more than two recent versions, but any problems related to older versions will be fixed with lower priority.

For security reasons, the `go.mod` file may require the latest available patch version (_e.g. 1.22.7_).
